            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I started my journey as a freelance computer technician after leaving community college
            I always had a passion for technology and entrepreneurship so I wanted to build my own company
            like the people I admire such as Bill Gates. Being from a small island and poor background I knew
            I had to work more if I wanted to accomplish my goals so I set out to seek further education and skills.
            I began by developing my skills as a Network System Admin, I started my own business which led to 
            an opportunity to work with a web development company from another country and from there I got into
            front-end development. Its been a long and hard journey managing School now that I am part of Brigham
            Young University, my business and my family but it has been a fruitful one. My business now manages the
            IT infrastructure for 3 small retail companies and we have partnerships with companies such as Ingram Micro,
            Microsoft, Sonicwall and many others.</p>
